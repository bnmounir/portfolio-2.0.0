                It took me about 3 days to build this website (quarantine has
                its ups I guess!), I put it on the the back burner for a while
                as the whole portfolio website can be tricky if you ask me, I
                tried using DivJoy a couple of weeks back (today is 03/22/20).
                <Anchor href='https://divjoy.com/'>DivJoy</Anchor> was featured
                on Product Hunt at the time, and it got me curious, it's pretty
                cool but it's very young still. the code for this app is hosted

                Dedication to coding as career started in 2018, at first I
                wanted to try and transfer some of my previous college degree
                credits (BS Environmental Engineering) and get a CS degree in a
                short amount of time. That didn't work with the colleges I
                applied to, so I opted for a time saver program, I ended up
                going to a year long coding bootcamp in NYC that started in
                september 2018 I've been coding none stop since, faced a lot of
                challenges, learned a lot and got to build some cool little
                apps.

                As far as bootcamps go they tend to be very experimental, a lot
                of trial by error and curriculum upgrades. While I was attending
                one, it felt unsettling to how little progress I was having, and
                instantly recognized the necessity of an outside source. I
                started taking several courses and tutorials online. Thats where
                I starting to build foundations in coding, using FreeCodeCamp,
                Dev.to, YouTube and Udemy to name a few, the Journey wasn't
                without bumps but the longer you persist the bigger the reward.

                Stated with the basics, and now slowly but surely I'm getting to
                have a wider knowledge about Software Engineering, how to
                approach problems how to solve challenges.
                <br />
                <br />
                So here's What I'm Doing: constantly trying to solve and
                understand Data Structure and Algorithms. currently trying to
                learn Golang, we shall see in few weeks how that goes!
                <br />
                Mobile development: I've been trying to develope apps with React
                Native; bad idea, tried Ionic because of the new integration
                with React, it looked like it was trying too hard to look like
                React with too many abstractions I decided to go with Flutter,
                in experimental phase I think I like it better, it has a great
                performance and it is backed by Google so I'm gonna give it my
                best (wish me luck).
